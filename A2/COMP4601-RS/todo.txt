LDA: Extract genres for all movies.
Create dictionary of {movieId: genreNumber}


/advertising/{category}
For each user category (community):
- ads are links to other movies that fulfil:
 - predominantly rated >= user average by users in community
- each ad should contain some topic summary of the movie
 - text summarizer on all reviews?
 - a particularly helpful (positive) review?


/fetch/{user}/{page}
Users each belong to a community
Advertising comes from the set of ads described above
- but is filtered to match to the genre of the current page
- and removing movies the user has already seen
- randomly selected from this subset


Evaluating model:
- How accurately does the 2D SVD preserve the original ratings?
- How accurate is the prediction via SVD, CF? (Split data into training/test to validate)
- Have users who are close in 2d rated a lot of the same movies?
- What is the distance between users in the social graph? (directly connected = 0)
- What is the distance between users based on common ratings? (see slides)
- Are these distances correlated? (I would think so)


Suggest:
- Place the new user in 2d space based on the distances in user graph
 - then, same system can be used for advertising
 - list of pages to visit is just the advertising for new user's computed community
- Or take "k nearest neighbours" to be the ones with close social proximity
 - and calculate recommendations based on that, as before.
- Pages are movies that fulfil:
    - predominantly rated >= user average by "k nearest neighbours" in social graph
 - We could use this model for advertising instead of closest neighbours by ratings
  (or some combination)

Future work:
- Timestamps could be used to provide recommendations only based on recent behaviour
- Helpfulness of a review (or userAvgHelpful) could give increased weight.
